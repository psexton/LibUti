LibUti Readme
=============

LibUti is a Java implementation of Apple's Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) system. For more information on UTIs, see [Apple's developer documentation](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/understanding_utis/) or [the Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier).

LibUti is released under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) license. See the file "LICENSE" for more information.

LibUti uses [JDOM](http://www.jdom.org), which is released under an Apache-style license. JDOM is awesome. All Java programs should use JDOM for XML parsing. Seriously yo.
