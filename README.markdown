LibUti also uses [JUNG](http://jung.sourceforge.net), which is released under the BSD license. (Jung, in turn, uses [Commons-Collections with Generics](http://collections.sourceforge.net), which is licensed under the Apache v2 license, and [COLT](http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt), which has its own BSD-ish license.)
